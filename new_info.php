              <p>J Lang Dang. So happy you chose to join EWG over Hilts two years ago today!!! Bloody hilts...haha. Massive thank you for everything you have done for the business and all of your Workforcers over your journey. Your passion for the role and commitment to providing the very best staff the industry has to offer is why you have excelled so much. Unfortunately I don't think you will ever understand the massive impact you have had on thousands of people's lives over the last two years but I hope you have found enjoyment from all of the great stories you have created so far. The future is exciting here and I really look forward to seeing you grow into the role even more, as you have done so much since you started. To many good years ahead</p>

              <p>Yo Michaela. What a change from the old days in richmond. I will admit I miss walking across the park to get a coffee, but I think the south melbourne change has been one for the better with the whole natural light in the office for one! Thank you so much for everything you bring to our team. The academy has been owned by you like never before and the way you care about all the workforcers never seices (<-thats not the right spelling) to amaze me. I know we are different people what with me being a jerk sometimes, but i love that we can still work so well together. Looking forward to seeing you in a week and for many more years. </p>
