            <p>The EWG Technology Platform is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the EWG Tech Platform. If you are a volunteer who is under the age of 13 years old, your parent or guardian must register on the EWG Technology Platform on your behalf to receive event notifications.</p>

          <h4>Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It </strong></h4>
            <p>The information we collect from and about users of the EWG Technology Platform is determined both by the event company that has partnered with Event Workforce Group (USA) Inc. (“Event Company”) based on the information they need about their event staff, and by the technological requirements of the EWG Tech Platform. The types of information that we collect from and about users of the EWG Technology Platform include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Information by which you may be personally identified that is requested by the Event Company, such as name, email address, and phone number (“personal information”);</li>
                <li>Information that you voluntarily enter to include in your EWG Technology Platform profile, such as volunteer experience, interests, and online social network login information, that may include personal information;</li>
                <li>Information that is about you but individually does not identify you, such as the city where you live; and/or</li>
                <li>Information about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access the EWG Tech Platform, and usage details.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>We collect this information:</p>

Although we do not correlate tracking information to individuals, some information collected, such as IP addresses, will be unique</li>
                </ul>
                
              <p>You may choose not to enter information into the EWG Tech Platform, but the services offered through the EWG Technology Platform and/or your ability to work at an event may be limited because identifying information is needed to facilitate some of the main services of the EWG Technology Platform or is required by the Event Company.</p>  
              
              <p>The EWG Technology Platform does not change its practices or functionalities when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.

                     <p>You can review and change your personal information by logging into the EWG Technology Platform and visiting your account profile page.</p> 
                     
                     <p>You may also send us an email at <a href= "mailto:info@eventworkforcegroup.com">info@eventworkforcegroup.com</a> to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us.

             <h3>Data Security</h3>                 
                     <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. For example, access by a user to his or her personal information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by the user. This information is encrypted through the EWG Technology Platform with Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and is also encrypted when it is stored by us to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Also, we perform regular malware scanning of the EWG Technology Platform and all servers and computers used by us to support the EWG Tech Platform. All EWG Tech employees are required to adhere to our security and confidentiality procedures and undergo training related to maintaining the security of user personal information.</p>                   
                     
                     <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for access to certain parts of the EWG Tech Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and be careful about giving out information in public areas of the EWG Tech Platform.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the EWG Tech Platform. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the EWG Tech Platform.</p>
