					<p>Event Workforce Group Holdings Pty Ltd. (along with its affiliates, Event Workforce Group Pty Ltd, Event Workforce Group Technology Pty Ltd & Event Workforce Group (USA) Inc.) known as ‘EWG’ provides online staff management tools and services for event coordinators. If you are volunteering or working at an event or you are coordinating an event using the website and/or mobile application that is hosted by ‘EWG (“EWG Platform”), your use of the EWG Platform and any information you provide while using the EWG Platform will be governed by this Privacy Policy (in addition to any additional terms, conditions, or guidelines provided to you by the event staff).
</p>

					<p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. <strong>If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not use the EWG Platform.</strong> By accessing or using the EWG Platform, you are agreeing that you understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

</p>

					<h3>Children Under the Age of 13</h3>
					<p>The EWG Platform is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the EWG Platform. If you are a volunteer or event staff who is under the age of 13 years old, your parent or guardian must register on the EWG Platform on your behalf to receive event notifications.
</p>

					<p>We do not knowingly collect information of any sort, including personal information, from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on the EWG Platform. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information immediately.

					<h3>Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It</h3>
					<p>The information we collect from and about users of the EWG Platform varies depending on how you are using the EWG Platform. If you are using the EWG Platform because you are volunteering or working at an event, the information we collect is determined by the event company that has partnered with EWG (“Event Company”) based on the information they need about their event staff, and by the technological requirements of the EWG Platform. If you are using the EWG Platform on behalf of the Event Company, then we collect information needed for your account on the EWG Platform so you can organize your event and staff.
</p>

					<p>The types of information that we collect from and about users of the EWG Platform include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Information by which you may be personally identified, either that is requested by the Event Company or to set up an account for or on behalf of your Event Company, such as name, email address, and phone number (“personal information”);
</li>
						<li>Information that you voluntarily enter to include in your EWG Platform profile, such as volunteer experience, volunteer needs, interests, and online social network login information, that may include personal information;/li>
						<li>Information used for billing purposes, such as credit card information and billing address;</li>
						<li>Information that is about you but individually does not identify you, such as the city where you live; and/or</li>
						<li>Information about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access the EWG Technology Platform, and usage details.</li>

					<p>We collect this information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Directly from you when you provide it to us.</li>
						<li>Automatically as you navigate through the EWG Technology Platform. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, web browser preferences, and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies. Although we do not correlate tracking information to individuals, some information collected, such as IP addresses, will be unique.</li>
					</ul>


					<p>You may choose not to enter information into the EWG Technology Platform, but the services offered through the EWG Technology Platform and/or your ability to work at or coordinate an event may be limited because identifying information is needed to facilitate some of the main services of the EWG Technology Platform or is required by the Event Company. </p>

					<p>The EWG Technology Platform does not change its practices or functionalities when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. Even if you turn this setting on in your browser, we may continue to track and collect personal information as stated in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want us to collect personal information from you, do not enter it into the EWG Technology Platform when possible or do not use the EWG Technology Platform.</p>

						<li>To set up an account for your Event Company and its staff.</li>
						<li>To send you alerts related to your use of the EWG Platform, such as to alert you about other volunteer events that we think might be of interest to you or to notify you about matters related to your event.</li>
						<li>To process payments that you make on the Website and manage your subscriptions to our services. </li>
						<li>To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us, or to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it</li>

									<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of ‘The Groups’ assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by EWG about the EWG Platform users is among the assets transferred.</li>

					<h3>Accessing and Correcting Your Information </h3>
					<p>You can review and change your personal information by logging into the EWG Platform and visiting your account profile page.</p>

					<p>You may also send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@eventworkforcegroup.com"> info@eventworkforcegroup.com.</a> to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect</p>

					<h3>Data Security</h3>
					<p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. For example, access by a user to his or her personal information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by the user. This information is encrypted through the EWG Platform with Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and is also encrypted when it is stored by us to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Also, we perform regular malware scanning of the EWG Platform and all servers and computers used by us to support the EWG Platform. All EWG employees are required to adhere to our security and confidentiality procedures and undergo training related to maintaining the security of user personal information.</p>

					<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for access to certain parts of the EWG Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and be careful about giving out information in public areas of the EWG Platform.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the EWG Platform. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the EWG Platform.</p>

					<h3>Third Party Links</h3>
					<p>The EWG Platform may contain links that lead to other websites, including links that the Event Company provides or links to volunteer opportunities for other events, and ‘The Group’ is not responsible for the privacy practices, content, and/or activities of these linked websites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the EWG Platform and welcome any feedback about these external websites. Users should keep this provision in mind whenever they follow a link to an external website and review the separate privacy policy terms of the external sites to which they are led. This Privacy Policy is applicable only to Rosterfy, the EWG Platform, and the information that we collect.</p>
